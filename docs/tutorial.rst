Here, we outline major functionality of the ``cosasi`` library. For more detailed documentation, please see the API reference.

Although the tutorial is intended to be read in sequential order, each page is written to be self-contained. Each page has some setup boilerplate (import statements, random seeds, graph generation, etc.) at the beginning that should be run first to ensure consistency with the command line outputs described throughout.

For an overview of graph diffusion source localization, we recommend `Diffusion Source Localization in Large Networks`_ by Lei Ying and Kai Zhu. This is the resource we reference the most in our source code.
